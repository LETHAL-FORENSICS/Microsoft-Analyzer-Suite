# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Issues

LETHAL-FORENSICS takes the security of our software products seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in any LETHAL-FORENSICS owned repository, please report it to us as described below.

### Reporting Process

1. Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.
2. Instead, please contact us directly via:
   - LinkedIn: [LETHAL-FORENSICS](https://linkedin.com/company/lethal-forensics)
   - You can reach out through LinkedIn's messaging system first, and we can establish a secure communication channel if needed.
3. Also, please be aware that there is no bug bounty program in place where you can expect a reward for your report.

### Requested Information

When reporting a security issue, please include:

- A clear description of the security vulnerability
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue
- System/environment where the vulnerability was discovered
- Version affected

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

## Preferred Languages
We prefer all communications to be in English or German.

Thank you very much!
